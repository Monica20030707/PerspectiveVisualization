# Real-Time Stock Data Visualization

This project provides a web-based interface to monitor stock prices in real-time, utilizing the Perspective tool developed by JPMorgan Chase. The application features a continuously updating line graph that displays stock prices, specifically the top ask price, with respect to time. The graph aggregates data and automatically updates based on live data feeds from the server.

## Installation

Step 1: Install Dependencies - npm install

Step 2: Run the Python server from the root of the project repository - python datafeed/server3.py

Step 3: Start the Client - npm start

## Objective
View the Real-Time Graph: Once the client application is running, the graph will automatically display and continuously update the stock's top ask price on the y-axis and the timestamp on the x-axis.
